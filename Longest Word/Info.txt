Have the function LongestWord(sen) take the sen parameter being passed and 
return the largest word in the string. If there are two or more words that are the same length, 
return the first word from the string with that length. 
Ignore punctuation and assume sen will not be empty.


NOTE: My solution does not account for numbers being treated as words so it fails any test involving those.
For interview reference, after coming up with some test cases ask the interviewer 
if there are any other requirements like numbers being treated differently or etc.
